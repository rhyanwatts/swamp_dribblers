# The Bike Sack
Raspberry Pi Project
Created for BITS SP2 by team Swamp Dribblers

The Bike Sack is a complete motorcycle computer solution. Using a Raspberry PI hardware the Java based solution manages and monitors all aspects of a motorcycle's electrical system. Information collected about the current state of the bike is output to screen to keep the rider well informed.

The Bike Sack is a motorcycle lighting and instrument system that is simple to install on any motorcycle. If you are building a custom bike, restoring an old one or just wish to upgrade your bike â€“ there is a Bike Sack model to suit you.

The Bike Sack uses a computer about the size of a wallet to control your motorcycle lights, collect information from sensors and provide feedback to the rider.
